        <h2>Understanding Suicide and Its Impact</h2>
        <p>Suicide is a tragic and complex issue that affects millions of people worldwide. It is often linked to mental health struggles such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness. Despite its prevalence, suicide remains a topic that many avoid discussing, which only adds to the stigma and silence surrounding it.</p>

        <h2>The Warning Signs of Suicide</h2>
        <p>It’s crucial to be aware of the <span class="highlight">warning signs</span> that someone may be struggling with suicidal thoughts. These signs can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Talking about wanting to die or feeling hopeless.</li>
            <li>Withdrawal from family and friends.</li>
            <li>Changes in mood or behavior, such as increased sadness or irritability.</li>
            <li>Substance abuse or reckless behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you notice these signs in someone close to you, it’s important to encourage them to seek professional help and let them know that they are not alone.</p>

        <h2>How to Support Someone in Crisis</h2>
        <p>If you suspect someone is considering suicide, your response can make a significant difference. Be open, nonjudgmental, and listen. Let the person know you care and that help is available. Encourage them to seek support from mental health professionals or a crisis helpline.</p>
        <div class="important">
            <p>If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, please reach out to a crisis hotline immediately. In the U.S., you can contact the <strong>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255)</strong> or text HOME to 741741.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Importance of Breaking the Silence</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest obstacles to addressing suicide is the stigma surrounding mental health issues. By speaking out and offering support, we can create a culture where people feel comfortable seeking help without fear of judgment.</p>

        <p>We must continue to raise awareness, educate, and break the silence. Everyone deserves to live a life free from the overwhelming pain that may lead someone to consider suicide. By spreading understanding, we can help save lives.</p>
